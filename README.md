# Alphabetic coding
Python package for coding theory.

## Targets
* Interface for encoding / decoding string of characters to binary sequence.
* Alphabetic coding (character wise coding).
  * Custom encoding (character -> binary sequence scheme).
  * Coding bijection checker.
  * Huffman coding.
* Regular coding.
  * Custom encoding + custom DFA (deterministic finite automaton).
  * Extracting DFA from source string.
  * Bijection checker.
  * Huffman coding extension (compare compression ratio changes).
* Text data compression (compressed binary file from text file).
* Other coding methods and comparison with each other.
* Documentation.

## Reasons
* Knowledge deposit.
* Space for experiments.
* Education of development.
